        <div class="subheading mb-5">Computer ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an inspired student chasing their education in order to broaden their chances in the future.  Currently I am a fourth year college student at the University of California: Riverside as a Biology major.  I have enjoyed my past four years studying Biology.  I also intern as a Health Scholar at Kaiser Permanente Riverside and help nurses and doctors on the hospital floors where I am needed.  For as long as I have wanted to go to college, I have always wanted to go into the medical field as it felt the easiest and most sense for me to pursue.  However, after a few years of working towards this goal I realize that it is not something I would like to do for a career.  I have been inspired to see what other paths I could take with my degree and what other fields I can work towards.e<br><br>

        I am almost done and about to get my bachelors, however I wanted to take a few more years in school in order to get a minor in Computer Science.  The reasoning for this would be to gain my prerequisites in order to be able to attain a masters in Computer Science.   I have been taking many intro classes into Computer Science recently and have been enjoying every bit of it.  I see myself diving deeper into the field with more advanced classes beginning this year and next year, and intend on expanding my knowledge with Computer Science a lot.  In the end, I want to have two degrees in two different fields in order to give me a great amount of opportunities in the future when choosing my career.  These two fields would be Biology and Computer Science, two very in demand fields when choosing careers.<br><br>

        The reason why I want to be able to have such a broad range of paths to pick from is because my family has not had the same opportunities I have been given.  Both my parents risked a lot coming to the United States as immigrants in order to give their children a chance to have a better life.  I intend on making their dream a reality, and I also intend on doing it in a way that I would feel happy doing so.  I also do not want to be at a point where I am stuck because I cannot find a way to go forward.  Having two degrees and the knowledge in fields such as Biology and Computer Science will hopefully make it easier on me later on in life.  I am content pursuing this new path as it is something that I want, my family wants, and can also benefit biology and tech moving forward.
